        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>24 oz jar of marinara sauce</li>
        <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh basil or parsley, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 2000°C.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the marinara sauce to the meat mixture. Simmer for 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Layer 3–4 noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture, then a layer of mozzarella, followed by more meat sauce. Repeat layers.</li>
        <li>Top the final layer with noodles, remaining sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.</li>
