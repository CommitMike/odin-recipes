    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vegetable risotto is a creamy, flavorful dish made by slowly cooking rice with vegetable broth and seasonal vegetables. It's a comforting and versatile meal that's naturally vegetarian and packed with freshness.</p>
    <p>Perfect as a main course or a side dish, this risotto highlights the rich, delicate flavors of the ingredients while maintaining a satisfying, hearty texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable broth, kept warm</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup diced carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup peas</li>
        <li>1 cup diced zucchini</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots, zucchini, and peas. Sauté for 3–4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the Arborio rice and cook for 1–2 minutes until lightly toasted.</li>
        <li>Begin adding the warm vegetable broth one ladle at a time, stirring continuously. Wait until the broth is mostly absorbed before adding the next ladle.</li>
        <li>Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked al dente, about 18–20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the butter and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, garnish with fresh parsley, and serve immediately.</li>
